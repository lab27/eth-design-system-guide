# ETH Design System Guide

A practical guide to implementing ETH Z端rich's visual identity in digital products.

## Overview

This project presents different approaches for implementing ETH Z端rich's design system, ranging from simple token documentation to comprehensive component libraries.

The guide addresses the challenge of creating consistent user experiences across ETH's diverse digital ecosystem while considering the tradeoffs between implementation quality and maintenance effort.

## Implementation Approaches

The guide presents three implementation options with increasing levels of comprehensiveness:

1. **Figma Dev Mode + Token Documentation** (Simplest)
   - Lightweight approach leveraging Figma's design tools
   - Minimal maintenance required
   - Basic implementation quality

2. **Tailwind Preset + UI Examples** (Middle ground)
   - Balance between flexibility and structure
   - Medium maintenance required
   - Good implementation quality

3. **Component Library with Integrations** (Most comprehensive)
   - Complete component ecosystem
   - High maintenance required
   - Excellent implementation quality

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the guide.

## Examples

Each approach includes an interactive example that demonstrates its implementation:

- `design-tokens.html` - Token documentation approach
- `tailwind-preset.html` - Tailwind preset approach
- `component-library.html` - Component library approach
